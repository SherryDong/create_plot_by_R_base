# Create plot by R base

Share with codes that create interesting plot by using R-base.


## Before Start

I really appreciate some fancy R packages for visualization and they are really great tools for people to use (e.g ggplot2 and htmlwidgets for R https://www.htmlwidgets.org/index.html). But I just like to design and create plots by R base, especially for figures used in manuscript (most not interactive). It is more flexible but sometimes complicated.

This tutorial is designed to share with my experience of how to play with R base.

The main idea of creating plots is to calculate the position of each item you want to display.

The html files (generated by R markdown) include the following sections:

### Preparations
### Demo1: create DNA double helix
### Demo2: create network plot
### Demo3: adjust a figure
### Demo4: create a plot with multiple subgraphs
### Demo5: create sankey diagrams and circos
